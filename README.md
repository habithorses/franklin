Benjamin Franklin is best remembered as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, but he achieved much more in his lifetime.

During Franklinâ€™s 84 years alive, he invented the lightning rod, made significant discoveries in physics and population studies, wrote best-selling books, composed music and played the violin, harp and guitar at a high level, founded many civic organizations, including the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and much more.

How did Franklin achieve so much more than his contemporaries, given he had the same 24 hours each day to get things done?
